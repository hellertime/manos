walk:

In a walk from/to this represents the steps taken to get there.

These are breadcrumbs that map the path back to, from where we
are. A reverse set of directions.

Since a trail is a result of a walk, the size of the trail will
be known at the start of the walk, though we may find that in 
the end the trail is shorter -- if the walk fails along the way.

getNodeInfo:

Every device that can populate the namespace must provide a
function which can make a NodeInfo structure for a node
or a node realtive to that node (Up, Prev, Next, Self)

Many devices will have very simple namespace structure and
can get by with an array of StaticNS objects to cover all
nodes. For those devices a generic getNodeInfo function
can be used.
